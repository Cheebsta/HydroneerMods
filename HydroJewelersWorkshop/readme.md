## The Gemporium Shop
Set just across the river from the fishing castle, Gemporium offers a complete line of gem cutting and jewelry merging equipment. Many basic digging and smelting tools are also available. And what roadside attraction would be complete without a hat tipping cactus and the worlds tiniest dragon skull?

Can you find the Easter Egg for another upcoming mod?

And who is that in the treehouse, and what are they looking at, just over the Hydroneer horizon?
