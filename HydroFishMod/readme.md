# The HydroFishMod
### Why dig when you can fish?

This mod adds several new species of fish to the game, along with a crafting table, a new rod, a machine to process the fish, and a large scale to weigh big fish.

To begin, you must find a pamphlet that contains instructions for building the table. As a clue, spend some time fishing near the vanilla fishing upgrades.

The table will allow you to craft the rod, grinder, and scale. Select a recipe by clicking the rolodex. Drop the required items onto the table and then click
on the table itself to spawn your item.

If your pamphlet gets lost, or you'd like to spawn another table, you can press "P" to spawn another pamphlet.
