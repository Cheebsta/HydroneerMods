 > Why dig when you can fish?

This mod makes it possible to collect all mineable resources by fishing!

Begin by finding a lost issue of Hydro Home & Garden that contains instructions for building a Fishing Bench crafting table. Spending some time around the Fishing Castle will help you in your search. *You'll still need to mine enough resources to make the table and rod.*

## The Items

<details open><summary>Hydro Home & Garden</summary>
The entry point for the mod. Found in the wilderness near the fishing castle. Enables construction of the Fishing Bench. Place 1 wooden foundation, 1 fishing rod, a screwdriver, and a construction hammer in a small pile with the pamphlet and then click on the pamphlet. For convenience, you can also hold the pamphlet while clicking. **The wooden foundation and fishing rod are consumed** and a Fishing Bench will spawn.

*If your pamphlet gets lost, or you'd like to have another table, you can press "P" to spawn another pamphlet in the default location.*

</details>

<details open><summary>Fishing Bench</summary>
This crafting table allows you to make the other items in the mod. Select a recipe by clicking the rolodex on the right hand side of the table. Place the required items on the table to the left of the rolodex. For items taller than the table, it may be easier to place themdirectly in front, or just to the left, of the table itself. This will not work, however, for items shorter than the table top.

</details>

<details open><summary>Magnetic Fishing Rod</summary>
Allows you to catch resource bearing aquatic life. Works like any other fishing rod, click to cast, click to reel in. Lure sinks to the bottom instead of bobbing on top and will bounce to indicate bite. There is a randomness factor involved in how long it takes for a fish to bite **and** how long you have to successfully reel in a fish after a bite. *Strange cable behavior on the first cast is a known bug, it should not affect the cast*

</details>


<details open><summary>Hydro-lic Fish Grinder</summary>
By breaking them down into their raw resource form, this machine allows aquatic life to be processed in a standard conveyor sorting system. Simply drop the creatures into the grinder and your resources will pop out of the large pipe on the side like an Italian plumber. Cannot process dirt, but is able to pass ores, shards, and uncut gems through unharmed. Requires water, not currently filtration or pressure dependent.

</details>

<details open><summary>Really Big Scales</summary>
Like any other scale, just bigger. Designed to weigh a small amount of really big fish, also able to weigh a large amount of really small fish. Chalkboard output works like a normal scale. Arrow is really just for fun and maxes out at 180 weights.

</details>

## The Fish

All fish can be processed using either a Smelter (non-logic) or Fish Grinder.

<details open><summary>Iron Catfish</summary>
One of the best cooks in the waters of Hydroneer. Highly magnetic. Large specimens may require Fish Grinder for processing.

</details>

<details open><summary>Golden Trout</summary>
An unfortunate schmelting accident has turned this trout into solid gold. Somehow also magnetic, just go with it.

</details>

<details open><summary>Cloutium Carp</summary>
It's like copper, but valuable. Also somehow magnetic... Just don't ask, okay? It's a theme we're doing here.

</details>

<details open><summary>Shard Shell</summary>
Also a nightlight. Your aquatic source for shard power.

</details>

<details open><summary>Rainbow Starfish</summary>
Like a box of chocolates, you never know what you will get. Processing with a Fish Grinder is recommended.

</details>

<details open><summary>Black Pearl</summary>
There's just a 1% chance to snag one of these. Produces uncut onyx. Processing with a Fish Grinder is recommended.
